# Individual components automatically register for being logged at startup
# and the default is to log all of them
#
# The "Log <componentname>" directive, if used, allows to specify
# one or more components to be logged, excluding all the others
# Example:
# Log adapter
# tells to the logging subsystem to *only* log the activity of the adapter plugin
# Here are some examples with components names:
# Log unregistered
# Log adapter
# Log mysql
# Log oracle
